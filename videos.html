        The laser scan data from lidar provides a 360-degree view to the the vehicle, which enables it to identify obstacles in the 
        surrounding environment. In the above video, the vehicle's lane following algorithm is improved by the lidar which detects the boundaries,
        as well as the obstacle in front to perform safe lane following.

        A deep convolutional neural network architecture, namely ResNet-18, is trained on lane images obtained from the car's camera. 
        A dataset for supervised learning was created by annotating the desired pixel location in the image where the car should move towards.
        The result is a model that can perform lane following through camera on both directions of the track. The training video can be found 
        below which emphasises the accuracy of the model trained as more data was collected based on variety of conditions.

        Detection of an obstacle using Lidar and then braking was implemented, which was further modified into a local path planning algorithm 
        (based on real-time lidar data) was developed to calculate motion commands (steering and throttle) for the vehicle to roam collision free 
        autonomously in the environment. Later, the same was acheived by training a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-18).

        The car was driven in a customised environment with obstacles to create a map using the onboard sensors and an algorithm called SLAM.
        The saved map can be used for localisation, path planning and other maneuvers.

        The image captured from car's camera is passed through an image processing pipeline to obtain lane markings and find a proper 
        a trajectory accordingly. Then, mean cross-track deviation error is calculated which is fed to a proportional-derivative-integral (PID) 
        controller for keeping the car on the track in between the lanes.

        The car's position and orientation is obtained via real-time lidar data by constantly performing a localision algorithm on a saved map, where
        a tajectory is defined in the form of waypoints. A geometric controller, namely Pure Pursuit, is used to calculate the steering angle and velocity
        of the car (based on its current states) to track the specified path.

        A two vehicle platoon was created by establishing communication between leader and follower vehicles through TCP/IP. The follower
        uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the gap between itself front car and maintain a safe seperation distance, which is used along
        with leader's state informations to calculate the required acceleration.
